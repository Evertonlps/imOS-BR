# **What is imOS?**
imOS is a modified version of Windows 10 that has been optimized to improve performance, reduce system delays, and enhance overall functionality.

imOS is an open source project and it comes preconfigured. This means that you will not need to apply any additional settings other than those already built into imOS.
